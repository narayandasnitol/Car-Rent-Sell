 \chapter{Introduction}

\textbf{}\\
We’re living in a world of click-and-consume. All our car customers can buy anything they want online. So, often in the auto industry, we forget that long before they hit the lot, consumers are looking online for their next car. To do that, we have to promote our inventory. As, we start to build our online inventory, think of it more as a front door to our dealership. We are welcoming people . We are showing them around. We are making them feel comfortable with our inventory. Our online inventory is a way for people to collect leads which is just one of many ways to rent and sell cars online. \\

\section{   Project Goal}

\noindent 



\begin{enumerate}
\item         It will optimize the time spend in the activities performed during the sale and rent purposes.

\item 	It will help customers to choose their dream car sitting at their home.

\item 	It will gain maximum business region.

\item        Providing better accessibility and up to date information for customer.

\item        Managing important data and information of car and customer and place.

\item	       Providing a friendly interface for the customer/tourist.
\end{enumerate}

\section{   Features}

\noindent 


\begin{enumerate}
\item         The main purpose of Car Rent and Sell is buy and rent cars online. Using this project anyone can rent/buy cars online including by budget, cities, model, company etc.

\item 	Our project is meant to give people a better and trustworthy platform where they can buy and rent cars of their own choice and obviously on their own terms and condition.

\item 	With the help of internet and computer systems a man from remote area can buy his car from anywhere the country/world.

\item        This project will provide facility to all buyer, seller and dealers for rent/sell cars. If anyone want to buy cars online, then first he will register in this website and then he can see all the details about the cars including prices, model and features.

\item        Any person can register in the website and after that he can buy and rent cars, compare the cars regarding budget, model, company, city. Unregistered person may only see common pages with all buyer and seller’s information.
\end{enumerate}

\section{    Feasibility Analysis}

\noindent Feasibility Analysis lets the developer foresee the future of the project and the usefulness. Feasibility Analysis of a system or website is according to its workability, ability to meet their user needs and effective use of resources. Thus when a new application is proposed it normally goes through a feasibility study. Here we are going to provide the feasibility of the project that is being designed and lists various areas that will be considered very carefully during the feasibility study of our website such as Technical, Economical and Operational feasibilities.
\noindent 

\newpage
\subsection{    Technical Feasibility }
The website must be evaluated from the technical point of view first. The assessment of this feasibility must be based on an outline design of the system requirement in the terms of input, output, programs and procedures. This website will be done with following elements given below :
\noindent 

\begin{enumerate}
\item  \textbf{Front-end Language:} HTML, CSS

\item  \textbf{Back-end Language:} ASP.NET
\\
\end{enumerate}



\subsection{    Economical Feasibility } 

Economical feasibility is the second part of resource determination. This includes the time of the system analysis team, the cost of doing a full systems study (including the time of employees) the cost of the business employee time, the estimated cost of hardware/software or software development. Developing this application is highly economically feasible. We don’t need to spend much money for the development of the system. The only thing to development with an effective supervision. The costs for the software developers and servers are reasonable and the company for which the project will be developed will be highly benefited by serving customers as well as selling auto parts as every details of the servicing and selling of parts will be listed in the system. So, we can say that our project is economically feasible.

\noindent 
\paragraph{}




\begin{table}

\subsection{   Operational Feasibility }
The system analyst must consider the operational feasibility of the requested project even if the technical and economic resources are both judged adequate. Operational feasibility is dependent on the human resources available for the project and involves projecting whether the system will operate and be used once it is installed. If users are virtually used to the present system, see no problems with it and generally are not involved in requesting a new system, resistance to implementing the new system will be strong. Chances for it ever becoming operational are low. Alternatively, if users themselves have expressed a need for a system that is operational more of the time, in a more efficient and accessible manner, chances are better that the requested system will eventually be used.  



\section{   Cost and Benefit Analysis}

Cost Benefit Analysis estimates and totals up the equivalent money value of the benefits and costs to the community of projects to establish whether they are worthwhile. Tangible and Intangible are the types of Cost Benefit Analysis.  The Cost Benefit Analysis of our project is given below:\\

\end{table}



\begin{table}
\subsection{    Cash Flow Analysis}
\noindent An examination of a company's cash inflows and outflows during a specific period. The analysis begins with a starting balance and generates an ending balance after accounting for all cash receipts and paid expenses during the period. The cash flow analysis is often used for financial reporting purposes. See also cash flow projection, cash flow forecast:\\

\caption{Cash Flow Analysis for Car Rent and Sell Website} 
 
\subsection{    Present Value Analysis}

\noindent Present value (PV) is the current value of a future sum of money or stream of cash flows given a specified rate of return. Future cash flows are discounted at the discount rate, and the higher the discount rate, the lower the present value of the future cash flows. Determining the appropriate discount rate is the key to properly valuing future cash flows, whether they be earnings or obligations.

\begin{table}
\section{   Project Scheduling}
Project scheduling is a mechanism to communicate what tasks need to get done and which organizational resources will be allocated to complete those tasks in what timeframe. A project schedule is a document collecting all the work needed to deliver the project on time. The table is given below:\\


\noindent \includegraphics*[width=5.3in, height=3 in]{figures/PS}

\subsection{   Gantt Chart}
A Gantt chart, commonly used in project management, is one of the most popular and useful ways of showing activities (tasks or events) displayed against time. On the left of the chart is a list of the activities and along the top is a suitable time scale. Each activity is represented by a bar; the position and length of the bar reflects the start date, duration and end date of the activity. The gantt chart of our project is given below:\\\\

\noindent 
\section{  Conclusion}

We know about that people in our country, who want to buy a new car, must have to go first in the car showroom., then choose his/her cars, then purchase it. This process is very time consuming. So, our main goal is to reduce the time-consuming factors.
